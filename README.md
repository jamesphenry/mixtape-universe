> *Emotional soundtracks, punky heartbreak, indie dreams. This is not just music—it’s memory curation.*

Welcome to **mixtape-universe** — a growing galaxy of curated playlists that span decades, genres, and emotional arcs. Every playlist is designed for flow: smooth transitions, evolving moods, and maximum feels.

Whether you're chasing the high of a 2004 breakup, driving under neon skies, or spiraling existentially in your room at 2AM—we've got a soundtrack for that.

## 🌌 Playlists

Each playlist is a fully self-contained vibe, with its own emotional arc, artwork, and format options (`.md`, `.m3u`, `.json`).

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [🎢 Emotional Rollercoaster](playlists/emotional-rollercoaster/playlist.md) | From youthful rebellion to quiet redemption. Grunge, punk, indie, and modern soul-benders. |
| *(More coming soon...)* | *(We’re always curating.)* |
